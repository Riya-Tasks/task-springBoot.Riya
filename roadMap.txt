To write a Spring Boot service that parses an XML file, goes to a particular section (e.g., the "xxx" path), falls back to another path (e.g., "x2x" path) if the first path is missing, and stores the key-values in a HashMap, follow these steps:

1. Project Setup
You will need the following:

A Spring Boot project.
Java's standard DOM XML parser or other parsers like JAXB (if necessary).
A REST controller to expose the service.

2. Add Dependencies to build.gradle

3. XML Parsing Service
Now, letâ€™s write the service that parses the XML file, checks the "xxx" path first, and falls back to the "x2x" path if the "xxx" section is not found.

4. REST Controller to Expose the Service
This controller will expose a REST API to trigger the XML parsing.

5. Main Class (Spring Boot Entry Point)

6. Run the Application
Run the Spring Boot application using Gradle:

7. Access the Endpoint
You can now access the parsing service by visiting: http://localhost:8080/api/xml/parse

8. If the XML file contains entries under the "xxx" path, they will be processed first. If the "xxx" path is missing, it will fall back to the "x2x" path and extract entries from there.

9. This setup provides a basic XML parsing service with fallback logic and exposes it through a REST API.
